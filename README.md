## Learn more

Here are a few common ways to use Nuclei for scanning:

### Single target scan

To perform a quick scan on web-application:

```sh
nuclei -target https://example.com
```

### Scanning multiple targets

Nuclei can handle bulk scanning by providing a list of targets. You can use a file containing multiple URLs.

```sh
nuclei -targets urls.txt
```

### Network scan
If you need to scan an IP range for network vulnerabilities, you can run. This will scan the entire subnet for network-related issues, such as open ports or misconfigured services.

```sh
nuclei -target 192.168.1.0/24 -t network/
```

### Scanning with your custom template

To write and use your own template, create a `.yaml` file with specific rules, then use it as follows.

```sh
nuclei -u https://example.com -t /path/to/your-template.yaml
```

### Connect with ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform

You can run the scans on your machine and upload the results to the cloud platform for further analysis.

```sh
nuclei -target https://example.com -cloud-upload
```

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is absolutely free and does not require any subscription. For a detailed guide, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/cloud/scanning/nuclei-scan).

### Our Mission

Traditional vulnerability scanners were built decades ago. They are closed-source, incredibly slow, and vendor-driven. Today's attackers are mass exploiting newly released CVEs across the internet within days, unlike the years it used to take. This shift requires a completely different approach to tackling trending exploits on the internet.

We built Nuclei to solve this challenge. We made the entire scanning engine framework open and customizableâ€”allowing the global security community to collaborate and tackle the trending attack vectors and vulnerabilities on the internet. Nuclei is now used and contributed by Fortune 500 enterprises, government agencies, universities.

You can participate by contributing to our code, templates library, or joining our team.
